AES - Advanced Encryption Standard
 - main symetric encryption method
 - the key sizes are 128, 192, 256 bits
 - it's a block alg. , block size = 16 bytes = 128 bits
 - specified in FIPS 197
 - NK = number of 32 bits words = 4, 6, 8
 - NR = numbe of rounds = NK+6 = 10, 12, 14
 - each round consists of 4 main functions
 - the 4x4 bites array called state: input, output
